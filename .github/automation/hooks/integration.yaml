conditions:
  and:

  Use the enhanced coordination prompt to analyze cross-feature integration impacts.
  
  #enhanced-coordination
  
  Please perform comprehensive cross-feature integration analysis focusing on:
  
  1. Dependency identification and conflict detection
  2. Shared component and interface analysis
  3. Integration sequencing recommendations
  4. Resource competition and bottleneck identification
  5. Communication protocol and data flow analysis
  
  Generate integration strategy with specific recommendations for coordination.
